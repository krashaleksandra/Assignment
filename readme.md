Minimum bounding box/rectangle for points
In GH file:
- use of bounding box constructor (points, plane as input)
- use of bounding box constructor (curve as input)
- 2D implementation for minimum bounding rectangle (XY orientation).
Constructing bounding rectangle through 2 points (minX, minY coordinates; maxX, maxY coordinates)
- 3D implementation for minimum bounding box (XY orientation) - works with 2D also.
Constructing bounding box through 3 intervals (results of division for maximum and minimum X,Y and Z coordinates)
